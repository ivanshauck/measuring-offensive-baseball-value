I suspect one would have to analyze various players changes in performance from one lineup to the next, also taking ballpark and year into account. This can get incredibly messy though as a players performance also varies naturally, without the need of external factors, so that method could produce extremely flawed results. Perhaps a study of how many good pitches a player gets would be more appropriate, this will be something to consider for future reference."

For the ballpark though I will only be taking the averages from visiting teams though, as the average OT/PA for a ballpark would end up coverging to be closer to the home teams general average, so this is done to reduce bias. I'll also be multiplying this average in national league ballparks by the ratio of average OT/PA in american league history to average OT/PA in national league history, this is done to account for the designated hitter factor in the american league. That is, national league parks should technically have less offensive production in general given that they didn't use the DH in the time period this study was done on. Ultimately the american league ballparks have an OT/PA of about 1.02 that of the national league ballparks, so the difference isn't drastic.  "

        "So we see the label encoded ballpark column has a correlation of about .12 to OT/PA, and the label encoded year column a correlation of about .10. So now what I'll do is the following; for each game I will take the ratio of OT/PA in the game to average OT/PA for the year played in, multiply this by the correlation of the label encoded year to OT/PA, and do the exact same with the average OT/PA of ballpark the game is played in. Next I divide this figure by the sum of the two correlations. And finally I'll multiply this by 100, this is mainly for the eye comfort of the statistic enthusiast, the same thing is done with era+ and ops+. I'll call this stat adjusted offensive total per plate appearance plus (or ADJ OT/PA +)."

        "Next I'll use baseball reference to get the game logs for both mike trout and miguel cabrera in 2012. I'll have to write a few functions to be able to properly get these game logs uploaded into a data frame. I'll also have to convert their ballpark played in value to the same format that's in the data from the game logs, that is in their mlb park ID format. I was able to get a dictionary of these mlb park id's from this link: https://www.seamheads.com/ballparks/about.php. If you scroll down on the page there is a download ballparks database link, click on that, download the document, and the park ID's will be found in an xml file inside the document called parks. Baseball reference lets you copy data from game logs in csv format, so what I did was paste that into the first cell of an excel spreadhseet. I then saved it in csv format, but when I uploaded it into a pandas dataframe there was one column, the first row was the column names separated by commas, then the values were in the following rows, also all in one column separated by commas, that's the main reason for all the formatting you'll see."

OPS+ rates the value of base hits solely based on how many bases the player collects, so more extra base hits will give you a higher figure ultimately than ADJ PA/OT +. In an extremely competitive professional league being almost one and a half times better than the average should be considered amazing though. "

Next up would be to also look at the distributions for negative offensive outcomes, such as strikeouts, groundouts, flyouts, and grounded into double play. Perhaps adding these to the regression equation would allow us to capture more of the variation in the runs scored variable through the variation in the features. I also plan to eventually write a function that will take any players game logs from baseball reference for a specific season, and output their adjusted offensive total and adjusted offensive total per plate appearance plus for that season."

  This project was made for the purpose of measuring overall offensive value for a baseball player in a season, adjusted to both the year they
played in as well as the ballparks they played in. The main method used is linear regression. The data was sourced from data quest, which there is a link
to in the data cleaning and exploration notebook. 
  It's my opinion that this statistic I created gives an accurate measure of the value of a player's offensive production. It doesn't adjust for position played, 
or for the lineup the player was hitting in, as I feel like factors such as those can lead to erratic measures of value. 
  The order to look through the project in would be the baseball cleaning and data exploration notebook first, the baseball ML modeling notebook second, and the baseball offensive value notebook third.
